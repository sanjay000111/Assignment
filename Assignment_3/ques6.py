#   Given three integers between 1 and 11, if their sum is less than or equal to 21, return their sum. If their
#   sum exceeds 21 and there's an eleven, reduce the total sum by 10. Finally, if the sum (even after
#   adjustment) exceeds 21, return â€˜BUSTâ€™.
#   blackjack(5,6,7) --> 18
#   blackjack(9,9,9) --> 'BUST'
